A project developed for CS410/510 (CS 588 in more recent years) to use with MapReduce.

Developed by: Team Green Bay (Scot Lambert, Elijah Rich-Wimmer, Kevin Jacobson, Jason Larson, and Tim Pugh)

This is a Python 3.7 application that uses Tkinter for file selection, and simply opens up a file to count unique words (E.G. "github", "GiThUb" and "GITHUB" would produce a count of 3).

As a reminder, I still need to confirm toupper/tolower is implemented :)
