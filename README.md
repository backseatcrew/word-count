A project developed for CS410/510 (CS 588 in more recent years) to use with MapReduce.

Developed by: Team Green Bay (Scot Lambert, Elijah Rich-Wimmer, Kevin Jacobson, Jason Larson, and Tim Pugh)

This is a Python 3.7 application that uses Tkinter for file selection, and simply opens up a file to count unique words (E.G. "github", "GiThUb" and "GITHUB" would produce a count of 3).

To do items:

-Need toupper/tolower during the splits so we can ignore case sensitivity.

-To select a text file in the tkinter file browser, you have to swap from "jpeg" to "all files". This should should be simple simple to remove.

-This at least works on simple txt files for now. Depending on the file format we're issued there is likley a good third party parser.

-Feel free to add more to do items! I only added it to the readme since I didn't know where else :S. Feel free to mod the code as well, I have no personal attachment to code.
